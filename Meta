error.message = err.message;  >>> ???

why using class??

/* First, we need to throw or create an Error. When we create our error,
we can define a .message property by passing in a string as a parameter.
This becomes our err.message, used later. Now we can attach a status code appropriate to the problem.
We should give Forbidden requests the 403 status code.

The last and most important step is to pass a parameter into next().
 If next receives an argument,
 Express will assume there was an error, skip all other routes, and send whatever was passed to any error-handling middleware you have defined.*/
